# European Options Pricing: Black-Scholes, Binomial Tree & Monte Carlo Simulation

This project implements and compares three fundamental models for pricing **European call and put options**:

- **Black-Scholes Analytical Model**
- **Binomial Tree Model**
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**

It is intended as a learning tool and practical reference for understanding the theory, implementation, and real-world application of option pricing and sensitivity analysis.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goals

- Implement the three standard models for European option pricing.
- Compare accuracy, performance, and assumptions.
- Visualize convergence behavior and parameter sensitivity.
- Calculate important risk metrics (Greeks) using both analytical and numerical methods.

## ðŸ’¡ Models Implemented

| Model              | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Black-Scholes      | Closed-form analytical solution under idealized assumptions.                |
| Binomial Tree       | Step-wise discrete model to simulate price paths and convergence behavior.  |
| Monte Carlo         | Simulates thousands of paths to estimate the expected payoff statistically. |
